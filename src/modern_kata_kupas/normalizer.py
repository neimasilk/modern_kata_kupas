class TextNormalizer:
    """
    Provides methods for normalizing text, specifically Indonesian words.

    Normalization typically includes converting to lowercase, stripping whitespace,
    and removing common trailing punctuation. Internal hyphens are preserved.
    """

    def normalize_word(self, word: str) -> str:
        """
        Normalizes a given word according to defined rules.

        The normalization process includes:
        1. Converting the word to lowercase.
        2. Stripping leading/trailing whitespace.
        3. Removing common trailing punctuation (e.g., '.', ',', '?', '!', ':', ';').
        Internal hyphens are preserved. Non-string inputs are first converted to
        strings, then stripped and lowercased.

        Args:
            word (str): The word to be normalized. Can be any type that can be
                        converted to a string.

        Returns:
            str: The normalized word. If the input `word` is None or results in
                 an empty string after stripping, an empty string is returned.
